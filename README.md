# FASTAPI meets NUXTJS

Here is a fun project I[^1] am doing so as to learn NuxtJS and Fast API.

## Nuxt Documentation[^2]

We are using Docus for documentation (It is planned to be open sourced in the following weeks).

We recommend to install the Docus extension for VS Code.

Run npx yarn stub once in the root directory
Go into the docs directory: cd docs
Install docs dependencies with npx yarn install
Run npx yarn dev to start Docus in development mode
The pages are generated from docs/content/, you can start editing them to start helping us on documenting Nuxt 3

## FastAPI Documentation[^3]

FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%. \*

Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors. \*
Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time debugging.
Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter declaration. Fewer bugs.
Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive documentation.
Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.
